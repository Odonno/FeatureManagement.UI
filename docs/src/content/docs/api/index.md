Once everything is setup, you can now consume the features in two ways:

- Either via self-consumption, inside your Web API. See [via C# code](./code.md),
- or via an external API so that other services can consume features through API calls
  - [via a REST API](./rest.md)
  - [via a GraphQL API](./graphql.md)
